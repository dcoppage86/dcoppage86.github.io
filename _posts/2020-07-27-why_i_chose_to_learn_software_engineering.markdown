When I was in high school I took an interest in light Html coding to build a blog for a band fan page haha. It wasnt anything spectacular but It was fun to dig into building something and slightly understanding the basic process. Originally, I was going to go to college for web design but life got in the way...well I got in the way with my band. I thought we might be able to pursue a bigger goal with music but it didnt work out. After some time soul searching and trying to find my place continuing music and working in warehouses I attending barber school. I became a fully licensed master barber in 2012, which has been a blessing to mine and my families lives. It gave me a bit of fulfillment knowing that I accomplished something and built a solid career. When COVID-19 hit the U.S. life changed, it put me out of work for 3 months and really shook my core. My career as a barber has become uncertain and it was time to shake things up for myself. Living the life with 3 kids and one on the way, no benefits through work, no 401k or retirement, everything just need to change for the better.

So here I am, Im able and ready. I want to build a future for my family that offers flexibility, fun, creativity and honestly a whole new world of OPPURTUNITY!!!! Lets get it!!!
